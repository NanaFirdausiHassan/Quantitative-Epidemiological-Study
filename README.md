# Quantitative-Epidemiological-Study
This project is a quantitative epidemiological study designed to examine the mental health effects of cannabis use following its legalization. It uses data from the 2021 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), covering responses from 47,291 U.S. adults. The study applies various statistical methods, including descriptive statistics and binary logistic regression, to investigate the relationship between cannabis use and major depressive episodes (MDE). It employs descriptive analysis to outline the prevalence of cannabis use and perceptions of risk, chi-square analyses to explore sociodemographic correlations, and binary logistic regression to assess the likelihood of experiencing MDE based on cannabis use severity.
